Documentation for config file options:

  "checkpointInterval": number
    Number of seconds between regular checkpoints.
    If 0, then no regular checkpoints.
    Defaults to 600 (10 minutes).

  "checkpointAtShutdown": boolean
    If true, save a checkpoint when the server shuts down.
    If false, don't save a checkpoint, which results in lost data.
    Defaults to true.

  "checkpointMinFiles": number
    Minimum number of checkpoint files in a directory.  While there are
    fewer than this number, then no checkpoints will be deleted.
    Defaults to 0.

  "checkpointMaxDirectorySize": number
    Maximum number of megabytes allowed for checkpoints in checkpoint
    directory.  If this value is exceeded and checkpointMinFiles is also
    satisfied, then one or more old checkpoints will be deleted to make
    room for the next checkpoint.
    Defaults to Infinity.
